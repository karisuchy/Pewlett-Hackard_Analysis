## Overview

The purpose of the new analysis is well defined
offering retirment package to those who meet certain criteria
Looking ahead to prepare for future vacancies

Assist HR with employee research. Specific questions: 
Who will be retiring? How many positions will PH need to fill? 
Help future-proof PH by generating a list of all employees eligible for retirement package. 

Data is stored on six different tables. Use SQL to build an employee database. data modeling, engineering, and analysis 

Mentoring program: experienced and successful employees stepping back into a part-time role instead of retiring completely. Their new role in the company would be as a mentor to the recently hired employees.

What's going on with the salaries?
Why are there only five active managers for nine departments?
Why are some employees appearing twice?
To help Bobby find these answers, we're going to create tailored lists.

## Results

### Retiring Employees
retiring_titles.csv
need bulleted list with 4 major points
- The general titles used by PH are almost useless - they need to be more detailed titles. 
-- Examples: What are the job responsbilities for "Staff". 
-- What is the difference between "Senior Staff" and "Staff". Finance Manager, Sales Manager, Marketing Manager require different knowledge, skills, and abilities. 
-- RIDICULOUS! 
-  90,398 positions listed on table
